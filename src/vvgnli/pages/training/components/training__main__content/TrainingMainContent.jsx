              The V.V. Giri National Labour Institute is committed to promote a
              better understanding of labour problems and to find various
              avenues to tackle them. To achieve this, the Institute, through
              its varied activities attempts to provide education with regard to
              labour issues in an integrated manner. The research activities,
              among other things, explore the basic needs of different groups,
              such data as are generated in research activities are used for
              designing new training programmes and modifying existing ones.
              Constant feedback from the participants is used for updating the
              training curriculum as well as redesigning training modules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Educational and training programmes of the institute may be viewed
              as potential vehicles of structural change in labour relations.
              They can help generate a more positive attitude for the promotion
              of harmonious industrial relations. In the rural areas, the
              programmes attempt to develop leadership at the grassroot level
              that can build and support independent organisations to look after
              the interests of the rural labour. Training programmes equally
              emphasize attitudinal change, skill development and enhancement of
              knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              The training programmes use an appropriate mix of audio-visual
              presentation, lectures, group discussions, case studies and
              behavioural science techniques. Apart from the Instituteâ€™s
              faculty, guest faculty are also invited to strengthen the training
              programmes.

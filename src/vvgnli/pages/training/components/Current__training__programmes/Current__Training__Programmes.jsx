    p3: "The growing diversification of work arrangements has become a distinct feature of today’s labour markets. Over the years it has been seen that automation and digitalization have transformed several traditional forms of employment and also led to the emergence of several new forms of employment, such as the ‘platform’ economy. As the world of work continues to evolve, shaped by global trends such as digitalisation, automation and globalisation, as well as socio-demographic changes, social protection systems will need to adapt to changing contexts and demands. While some emerging work and employment arrangements may provide greater flexibility for workers and employers, they may also lead to significant gaps in social protection coverage. It is therefore necessary to strengthen and adapt a social protection system that would address the gaps and changes. A strong social protection system plays a key role in preventing poverty, reducing inequality, enhancing income security and enabling workers and their families to better navigate work and life transitions..",

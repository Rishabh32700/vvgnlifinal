              Research occupies a primary place in the activities of the
              Institute. The subject of research comprises a broad spectrum of
              labour-related issues and problems, in both the organised and the
              unorganised sectors. While deciding the topics of research, care
              is taken to identify subjects and issues of topical concern and
              relevance to policy formulation. The Institute continues to place
              great emphasis on the problems and issues of labour in unorganised
              and organised sectors in general and the more disadvantaged among
              these such as child labour, women labour and rural labour, in
              particular.

              Research activities also explore the basic needs of different
              groups of trainees such as trade union leaders and organisers in
              both organised and unorganised sectors, managers of public and
              private sectors, labour administrators, and volunteers of
              non-governmental organisations. The following ten Centres carry
              out studies on the major themes related to research:

                  The Integrated Labour History Research Programme (ILHRP) is a
                  specialised research programme on labour history research, set
                  up in collaboration with the Association of Indian Labour
                  Historians (AILH), a body of professional historians and
                  scholars interested in history of labour. The overall aim of
                  the ILHRP is to initiate, integrate and revive historical
                  research on labour in India and is the first of its kind in
                  the country. The programme has three mutually reinforcing
                  components such as digital archiving of Indian labour; writing
                  labour history of India; and interdisciplinary research. The
                  archive systematically collects and preserves various
                  documents and material concerning the working class in digital
                  form, through collaboration and networking with various
                  stakeholders (such as trade unions, NGOs, governmental
                  departments and business houses). Networking with similar
                  agencies (national and international) involved in digital
                  archiving is also a crucial aspect of the archive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So far, the archive is the country's largest digital
                  repository of labour documents, with more than 15 gigabytes of
                  data on Digital Archives of Indian Labour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The programme has so far more than 50 completed/ongoing
                  research and collection projects. Since year 2000, the
                  programme has published 20 working papers and organised around
                  90 seminars/discussions, including 12 international seminars
                  on labour history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The collections for the archives are generated through
                  undertaking research and collection projects on prioritised
                  areas of labour history, which involves networking with
                  experts and agencies, both within and outside the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The programme also organises regular academic discussions,
                  seminars and colloquia on the prioritised areas of labour
                  history.

                <b>International Conferences on Labour History</b>
                <br />
                <p>
                  One of the most significant contributions of the ILHRP has
                  been the 12 major International Conferences on Labour History
                  organised to deliberate on significant themes like Towards
                  Global Labour History: New Comparisons’, ‘Expanding the
                  Frontiers of Labour History’, ‘Work and Non-Work: Histories in
                  the Long Term’, and ‘Labour History – A Return to Politics’,
                  and ‘The Future of Work in the Mirror of the Past’. These
                  conferences provide an important platform for historians,
                  social scientists and scholars to deliberate upon varied
                  dynamics of labour history, furthering the historical
                  understanding of the conditions on labour and labouring
                  people. Scholars from around 20 countries across the world
                  have been participating in the conferences on Labour History.

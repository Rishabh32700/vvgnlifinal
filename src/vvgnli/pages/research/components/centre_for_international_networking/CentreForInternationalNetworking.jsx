                  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between V.V. Giri National
                  Labour Institute (VVGNLI) and International Training Centre
                  (ITC) of International Labour Organisation (ILO) Turin, Italy
                  for professional collaboration was signed on October 30, 2012.
                  The purpose of this MOU is to expand the collaboration between
                  the two institutions in training activities to promote decent
                  work for all. The two organisations will work together in
                  areas of mutual interest for activities, inter alia, related
                  to (i) organising collaborative training and education
                  programmes; (ii) developing training modules; and (iii)
                  faculty exchange. Such a collaboration is expected to result
                  in upgradation of technical capacities of both the
                  institutions in responding to the challenges emanating from
                  transformations in the world of work. The collaboration will
                  also aim to evolve V.V. Giri National Labour Institute as a
                  training institution for the SAARC region to begin with and
                  developing it further as an internationally acclaimed centre
                  of excellence in training on labour and related issues.

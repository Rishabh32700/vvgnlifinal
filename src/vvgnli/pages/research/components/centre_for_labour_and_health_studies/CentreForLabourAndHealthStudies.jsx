                <b>Aims and Objectives</b>
                <p>
                  Globalisation has led to increasing informalisation of work in
                  the developing countries, whereby workers have less access to
                  social protection. On the one hand flexible, precarious and
                  insecure forms of work with greater health risks have
                  increased. On the other hand, safety and protection systems
                  designed for formal workplaces and workers in the formal
                  sector are often inaccessible to informal workers. Moreover,
                  in many developing countries, governments have been compelled
                  to limit welfare programmes including health services through
                  public expenditure. This has increased health insecurities and
                  vulnerability for majority of the workers in the developing
                  countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In India where a large number of people are poor and depend on
                  the informal sector for their livelihood, providing horizontal
                  equity in terms of health protection and benefits becomes a
                  challenge. In order to address these key issues of health
                  protection and its interlinkages with the world of work, the
                  Centre for Labour and Health Studies has been set up in V.V.
                  Giri National Labour Institute. This specialised Centre
                  focuses on understanding and addressing emerging health
                  challenges confronting workers in a globalised economy. The
                  core research areas of the centre are as follows:

                  The impact of climate change is a global concern and in India
                  where large numbers of people are poor and dependent on
                  agriculture and informal sector for their livelihoods, the
                  impact of climate change is quite critical. In order to
                  address key issues relating to climate change and its
                  inter-linkages with the world of work, the V. V. Giri National
                  Labour Institute has set up a new research centre namely
                  Centre for Climate Change and Labour in the year 2010. The
                  major objective of the research centre is to carry out policy
                  oriented research on climate change and its inter-linkages
                  with labour and livelihoods. The core research areas of the
                  centre are as follows:

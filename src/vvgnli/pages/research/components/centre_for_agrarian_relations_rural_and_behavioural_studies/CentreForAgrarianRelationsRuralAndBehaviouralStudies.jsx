                <b>Aim & Activities</b>
                <p>
                  Worldwide Labor markets play a key role in shaping employment
                  and income levels in rural areas. Despite the fact that
                  agriculture sector alone cannot be predicted to absorb all of
                  the rural labour force substantially , still its association
                  in generating employment, and contribution towards variegation
                  of the economy, are significant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Access to labour markets is predominantly necessary for rural
                  population, as this may be their one and only resource of
                  sustaining their livelihood. Often, the only talent possessed
                  by these workers is their labour. Therefore, it is all the
                  more important to strengthen the functioning of rural labour
                  markets, as this is the only effectual way of humanizing the
                  efficiency of their foremost talent, and occupation.
                  Meaningful adoption of sustainable agriculture practices for
                  employment generation and labour markets is a key concern. For
                  this detail research is needed, as there are only very limited
                  evidence of rural economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With growing complexities in agrarian relations and rural
                  labour markets, it was felt that there is a need to analyze
                  these complexities more scientifically and systematically
                  through an integrated approach so that appropriate policies
                  and programmes could be formulated to suit to the needs of the
                  rural labour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For attaining sustainable growth and equity, awareness on
                  policies, skill development, capacity building, social
                  dialogue and empowerment through training, research and
                  advocacy would be some of main activities undertaken by the
                  “Centre for Agrarian Relations and Rural Labour Studies”.
                  Within this framework the activities of the centre are
                  envisaged to upgrade the status of V.V. Giri National Labour
                  Institute in the area of research, education, training and
                  advocacy on various dimensions pertaining to agriculture and
                  rural labour in the world of work.

                  Child Labour occupies a very high place in the agenda of
                  Research, Training and related activities of the V.V. Giri
                  National Labour Institute. Towards contributing to the
                  on-going efforts of prevention and elimination of child labour
                  in the country, ever since its inception, the NRCCL has been
                  focusing in the areas of Research, Training, Evaluation,
                  Technical Support, Advocacy, Documentation, Publication and
                  Dissemination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Research activities have endeavoured to bridge the existing
                  and the Centre’s knowledge gaps on various aspects of child
                  labour. The focus of research has been to explore the
                  unexplored issues and to assess the magnitude, enforcement of
                  legislation, impact of state and nonstate interventions,
                  living and working conditions, occupational health hazards,
                  etc. The methodology adopted in these studies includes
                  quantitative survey methods, participatory research methods
                  and case studies using a range of research tools.

                  Imparting training is one of the activities of NRCCL with the
                  objective to develop capabilities of various target groups
                  towards progressive elimination of child labour in India.
                  NRCCL has been conducting a number of Sensitisation
                  programmes, Capacity Building programmes, Orientation
                  programmes, Training of Trainers programmes and Awareness
                  Generation Programmes. The training programmes form a part of
                  the Centre’s endeavour to create a large group of trainees
                  from different geographical regions. The uniqueness of these
                  programmes is that every programme is meticulously designed to
                  meet the training needs of each target group. A common feature
                  of all these programmes is that a special emphasis is placed
                  on the sensitization of trainees on the issue of child labour
                  so as to induce in them attitudinal changes, thus enabling
                  them to become change agents. Participants for these
                  programmes are drawn from different Government Departments and
                  Organizations including Central Board of Workers’ Education,
                  Labour, Social Welfare, Social Justice and Empowerment,
                  Health, Rural Development, Women Development and Child
                  Welfare, Factories, Education, Cooperatives, Home, Revenue.
                  The other target groups are the Research Scholars,
                  representatives of Media, Employers’ Organisations, Trade
                  Unions, Non-Governmental Organizations, Rural Workers’
                  Organisations, parents of Child Labour, Employers, Panchayati
                  Raj Institutions (Local Governing Bodies), Academic and
                  Training Institutions, Students of Social Work, Teachers’
                  Associations.

                  NRCCL makes special efforts to hold various in-house,
                  state-level and national seminars on various themes with the
                  objective of sharing knowledge and information and to decide
                  on the modalities and course of action for dealing with
                  specific issues relating to child labour. The outcomes of
                  these seminars have resulted in evolving innovative
                  strategies, programmes and actions in different parts of the
                  country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides, the Seminars and Workshops and the publication
                  activity of the NRCCL is used as a tool of dissemination of
                  information on different aspects of child labour especially in
                  the context of information on the issue of child labour
                  growing exponentially. The various components of this activity
                  include Systematic Collection of Relevant Literature,
                  Classification of Collated Information, Periodical
                  Dissemination, Collection & Documentation of AudioVisuals and
                  Developing Audio-Visuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to multiply its efforts towards prevention and
                  elimination of child labour, technical support has been
                  provided to various organisations and Institutions and
                  Individual Scholars to conduct research projects, action
                  programmes, evaluation, to carry out advocacy and campaign
                  against child labour practice, to conduct child labour survey,

                  systems and in conducting seminars and workshops.

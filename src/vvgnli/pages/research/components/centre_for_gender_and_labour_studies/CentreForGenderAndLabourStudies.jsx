                <p>
                  Centre for Gender and Labour Studies has been set up with the
                  objective of addressing and strengthening the understanding of
                  gender issues in the world of work. Gender equality and
                  empowerment of women has been the cornerstone of developmental
                  policies of many countries across the globe. The recent
                  Sustainable Development goals 2015 recognizes the centrality
                  of women’s empowerment and gender equality for elimination of
                  poverty and hunger and the achievement of truly sustainable
                  development. Gender gap in labour force participation rates
                  and unemployment rates are persistent features of global
                  labour markets. These issues need to be addressed to ensure
                  gender equity in the labour market, which requires concerted
                  efforts both at academic and policy level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Labour market gender gaps are more pronounced in developing
                  countries, and often exacerbated by gendered patterns in
                  occupational segregation with the majority of women’s work
                  being concentrated in a narrow range of sectors that remain
                  vulnerable and insecure. These workers are mostly engaged in
                  the informal employment as domestic workers, self-employed,
                  casual workers, piece-rated workers, home based workers and
                  migrants workers with poor skills, less earnings and low
                  productivity. Further, the gender pay gap and wage
                  differentials remains a serious concern that needs to be
                  addressed. Apart from this, the contribution of women to the
                  national economy is still subject to more under reporting and
                  misrepresentation in comparison to the contribution of men.
                  The statistics available are partial and contribute to
                  maintaining a distorted perception of the nature of a
                  country’s economy and its human resources thereby perpetrating
                  a vicious circle of inequality between men and women caused by
                  inappropriate perceptions, policies and programmes. Given the
                  challenges women are facing in the labour market, promoting
                  gender equality and empowering women is fundamental for
                  achieving the new targets of full productive employment and
                  social inclusion to mark the global goals on sustainable
                  development.

                  For achieving inclusive growth and substantive equality,
                  awareness on policies, skill development, capacity building,
                  social dialogue and empowerment through training and research
                  would be some of main activities undertaken by the Centre for
                  Gender and Labour Studies. Within this framework the
                  activities of the centre are envisaged to upgrade the status
                  of .V.V. Giri National Labour Institute in the area of
                  research, education, training and advocacy on various
                  dimensions of gender and the labour market

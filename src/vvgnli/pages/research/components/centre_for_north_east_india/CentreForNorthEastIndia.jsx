                  The North Eastern Region (NER) of India constitutes 7.9 per
                  cent of country’s total geographical area and 3.8 per cent of
                  total population of the country (Census, 2011). It stretches
                  from the foothills of the Himalayas in the eastern range and
                  is surrounded by Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Nepal and Myanmar.
                  It includes eight states- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur,
                  Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. Troubled by
                  history and geo-politics, the NER has remained one of the most
                  underdeveloped regions of the country. Inadequate
                  infrastructure and poor governance is combined with low
                  productivity and market access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  NER constitutes 3.6 per cent of India’s total workforce
                  (2011–12). The labour scenario in the NER is quite unique
                  compared to other regions of the country owing to a multitude
                  of factors (including geographical, socio-economic and
                  political). The region is marked by lower rate of
                  industrialization and limited spread of modern service sector.
                  The agricultural operations are also distinct (with the
                  presence of unique systems like jhuming). Cultural ethos
                  governing labour market participation is also different, which
                  inter alia reflects on the distinctive composition of the
                  labour force – across gender and social categories. Yet
                  another important aspect is migration, which gets complicated
                  due to several socio-political considerations – both in terms
                  of internal migration of population (from within and outside
                  the region) as well as in terms of influx of labourers across
                  national boundaries.

                  It is in this context that the Institute has set up Centre for
                  North East (CNE) in 2009 to carry out policy oriented research
                  and conduct workshops/seminars and training on issues related
                  to labour, employment and social protection in the North
                  Eastern Region. The research and training areas are as
                  follows:

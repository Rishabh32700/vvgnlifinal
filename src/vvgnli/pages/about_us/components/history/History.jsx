                The National Labour Institute, as the V. V. Giri National Labour
                Institute was known until 1995, was first conceived in 1962. The
                need for an autonomous institute to undertake and coordinate
                research in the field of labour was a prominent part of the
                development agenda of the country and the Institute got
                established in the year 1974 as an autonomous body of the
                Ministry of Labour & Employment, Govt. of India.

                The Institute was renamed in 1995 in honour of Shri V.V. Giri,
                former President of India, renowned trade union leader and doyen
                of labour studies in the country. Over the years, the Institute
                has emerged as a premier institution in the country involved
                with research, training, publication and consultancy on labour
                and labour related issues.
